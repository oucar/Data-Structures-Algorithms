### Recursion 

* Recursive functions call themselves. 
* Tracing: Graphing recursion using tree structure. (AKA: **Tracing tree of a recursive function**)
  * Code goes to the previous call after it is terminated. 
* Recursion has two phases: Calling (ascending) and returning (descending) phase. 
* Loops have only calling (ascending) phase.
