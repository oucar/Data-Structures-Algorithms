## Recursion 

* Recursive functions call themselves. 
* Tracing: Graphing recursion using tree structure. (AKA: **Tracing tree of a recursive function**)
  * Code goes to the previous call after it is terminated. 
* Recursion has two phases: Calling (ascending) and returning (descending) phase. 
* Loops have only calling (ascending) phase.
* Activation record will be created for every new recursive call and its variables.
  * Activation records(for the function and its variables) will be deleted after the call ends
* Recursive functions: **O(n)**
  * given: *n*
  * function calls: *n+1*

 ```cpp

std::cout << n;// (5 4 3 2 1) --> Ascending (Calling time)
generalisingRecursion(n - 1); // ------> RECURSIVE FUNCTION (Returning Time)
std::cout << 10; // (10 10 10 10 10 ) --> Descending (Returning Time)
std::cout << n;// (1 2 3 4 5) --> Descending
```

### Recurence Relation - Time Complexity of Recursion
It depends on the function.

```cpp
void func(int n) {		 // i(n)
	if (n > 0) {   		 // 1
		std::cout << n;  // 1
		func(n - 1);     // i(n-1)
	}//end if
}// end func()
// O(n)

```

### Static and Global Variables in Recursion 

* If you use ```return func(n-1) + n;```, a new integer ```n``` will be created everytime you call ```func(n-1)```. So, use ```static int``` and increment or decrement it. Check "Static and Global Variables in Recursion"
	*  Static variables declared in functions, global variables declared outside of the function but they both function same. They will be created in code section.

---
### Types of Recursion
* **Tail**: Recursive function that calls itself, but that call is the **last statement of the function.** There MUST be nothing after the recursive function call.

	* Everything will be called in **calling time**. 
	* Nothing will be called in ~~returning time~~.
	* Can easily be converted to loop.
		* But for ```n = 3```, recursion will create 4 activasion records (Space complexity: Order of n) in the stack. Altough a loop only creates 1 activasion record (Space complexity: Order of 1). 
		* So, a loop is more efficient than a tail recursion.
```cpp
   //...
	 func(n-1);     // tail recursion 
	 func(n-1) + n; //not a tail recursion
   //...
```
	
	
* **Head**: Recursive function that calls itself, but that call is the **first statement of the function.** There MUST be nothing before the recursive function call.
	* Everything will be called in **returning time.**
	* Nothing will be called in ~~calling time.~~
	* It **cannot be easily** converted to a loop.	
* **Tree**: [Check this](https://i.imgur.com/UI2haOK.png)<br> 
	* Linear Recursion: Recursive function that calls itself one time.
	* Tree Recursion: Recursive function that calls itself **more than one time.**
	* **Time: O(2^n)**
	* Space: O(n)
* **Indirect**: More than one section calling **each other (circularly).**
* **Nested**: Will **pass the parameter as recursive call.**
	*  Recursion inside a recursion.
