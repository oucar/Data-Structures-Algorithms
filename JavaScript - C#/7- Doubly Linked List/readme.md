# Doubly Linked List
- In a doubly linked list, each node contains references to both the next and previous nodes. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions, but it requires additional memory for the backward reference.
- We are more flexible with a doubly linked list, but it requires more memory as we need to store two references for each node.
