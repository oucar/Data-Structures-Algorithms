### Useful when comparing multiple arrays, strings, etc.


## Frequency Counter Pattern
#### Explanation: [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solve-technical-interview-questions-using-frequency-counter/)
  
> Examples:

:star: Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The fruequency of values must be the same. (same.js)<br>

:star: Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of anothers, such as cinema, formed from iceman. (anagram.js)<br>

:star: Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in array, but it will always be sorted. (countUnique.js)<br>

:star: Accepts two arrays, Function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same. (squaredFreqSame.js)<br>

:star: Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits. (sameFreq.js)<br>

:star: Write a function called areThereDuplicates, which accepts a variable number of arguments, and checkes whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in. (areThereDuplicates.js)<br>
