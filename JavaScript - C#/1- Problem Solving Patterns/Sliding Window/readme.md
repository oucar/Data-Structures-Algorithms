* Great fit for if there's some kind of iteration
* Good with array, strings, linked lists etc.
* Min, max, longest, shortest, containes followings, etc.
* You usually work with some sort of subset.

> This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created.) Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in array/string etc.



- Contiguous sequence!
- Fixed length -> Max sum subarray of size k
- Dynamic length -> Longest subarray with at most k distinct characters, smallest sum >= some number etc
