## Frequency Counter Pattern
#### Explanation: [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/solve-technical-interview-questions-using-frequency-counter/)
  
> Examples:

:star: Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The fruequency of values must be the same. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/same.js)<br>

:star: Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of anothers, such as cinema, formed from iceman. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/anagram.js)<br>

:star: Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in array, but it will always be sorted. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/countUnique.js)<br>

:star: Accepts two arrays, Function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/squaredFreqSame.js)<br>

:star: Write a function called sameFrequency. Given two positive integers, find out if the two numbers have the same frequency of digits. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/sameFrequency.js)<br>

:star: Write a function called areThereDuplicates, which accepts a variable number of arguments, and checkes whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/areThereDuplicates.js)<br>



## Multiple Pointers Pattern
#### Explanation: [Link](https://medium.com/@kasiarosenb/algorithms-multiple-pointers-9843e1b5f1e1)

> Examples:

:star: Write a function called sumZero which accepts a SORTED array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values tham sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exists. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/sumZero.js)<br>

:star: (?) Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string. In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/isSubsequence.js)<br>

:star: Write a function called averagePair. Given a sorted array of integers and a target average, determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals the target average. There may be more than one pair that matches the average target. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/averagePair.js)<br>




## Sliding Window Pattern
#### Explanation: [Link](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/javascript-algorithm-2-sliding-window-66622c7cb4f8)
> This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created.) Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in array/string etc.
> Examples:

:star: Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called n. The function should calculate the maximum sum of n sensecutive elements in the array. [Link](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS%2C%201-%20Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/maxSubarraySum.js)<br>

  
## Divide and Conquer Pattern
#### Explanation: [Link](https://hackernoon.com/divide-and-conquer-binary-search-in-javascript-et233zgt)
> This pattern involves diving a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data. This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity. --> Quick and Merge Sorts
