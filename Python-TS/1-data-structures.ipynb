    "- accessed efficiently\n",
    "- modified easily\n",
    "- processed correctly inside a program\n",

    "An algorithm is a set of **well-defined instructions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a **step-by-step procedure** designed to solve a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms:\n",
    "- operate on data\n",

    "## Why DSA Is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "DSA is important because it:\n",
    "- helps organize data efficiently\n",
    "- allows problems to be solved in a structured way\n",
    "- improves performance and efficiency (time and memory)\n",
    "- makes programs faster and more scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is **no single perfect data structure** for all problems\n",
    "- Each data structure has **trade-offs**\n",
    "- We choose the **most suitable or near-optimal** option based on the problem\n",
    "- Efficiency is often measured using:\n",
    "  - **Time Complexity**\n",
    "  - **Space Complexity**\n",

    "## Main Goal of DSA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Store data efficiently\n",
    "- Process data quickly\n",
    "- Solve problems in an optimized way\n"
