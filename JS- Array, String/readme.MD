:star: [Accepts two arrays, Function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same.](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS-%20Array/squaredFreqSame.js)<br>
:star: [Given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of anothers, such as cinema, formed from iceman](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS-%20Array/anagram.js)
:star: [Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values tham sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exists.](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS-%20Array/sumZero.js)
:star: [Implement a function called countUniqueValues, which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in array, but it will always be sorted.](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS-%20Array/countUnique.js)
:star: [Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a number called n. The function should calculate the maximum sum of n sensecutive elements in the array.](https://github.com/oucar/Data-Structures-Algorithms/blob/master/JS-%20Array/countUnique.js)
