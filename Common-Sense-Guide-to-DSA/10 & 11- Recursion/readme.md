### Recursion
- Call Stack in Recursion works similar to Stack data structure (LIFO).
- The function that was called last (that is, most recently) is the function we need to complete first.
-  In the case of infinite recursion --> **Stack Overflow**
- Traversing thru the filesystem can be done easily using recursion.
- Useful algorithm when the algorithm needs to dig into an arbitrary number of levels deep into something.
