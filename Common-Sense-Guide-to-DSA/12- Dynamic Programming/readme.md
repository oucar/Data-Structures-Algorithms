### Dynamic Programming
- Dynamic programming is the process of optimizing recursive problems that have overlapping subproblems.
- Dynamic Programming can help eliminating some of the traps found in recursive code.
- Recursion is often the culprit behind some of the slowest categories of Big o, Such as O(2^N)
- Avoiding extra recursive call is key to keeping recursion fast..

- Another way of optimizing the recursion is going bottom-up. It basically is to ditch recursion and use some other approach (like a loop) to solve the same problem.
